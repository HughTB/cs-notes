\section*{Languages}

In this context, a \textbf{language} is a set of symbols which can be combined to create a list of acceptable \textbf{strings}.
 There are then also rules which tell us how to combine these strings together, known as \textbf{grammars}. The 
 combination of an alphabet, list of valid strings and grammars is known as a language. There will be a formal definition
 later on.

\begin{definition*}{}{}
  An \textbf{Alphabet} is a finite, non-empty set of symbols.
\end{definition*}

For example, in the English language we would define the alphabet, $A$, as $A = \{a, b, c, d, \ldots, x, y, z\}$. These
 symbols can then be combined to create a \textbf{string}.

\begin{definition*}{}{}
  A \textbf{String} is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet of a language.
\end{definition*}

With the alphabet $A$, we could have strings such as `$cat$', `$dog$', `$antidisestablishmentarianism$', etc \textit{over} the
 alphabet. A string with no symbols, and therefore a length of zero, is known as the \textbf{empty string}, and is
 denoted by $\Lambda$ (capital lambda).

\begin{definition*}{}{}
  A \textbf{Language} over an alphabet (e.g. English over $A$) is a set of strings -- including $\Lambda$ -- made up of
   symbols from $A$ which are considered `valid'. They could be valid as per a set of rules, or could be arbitrary as
   in most spoken languages.
\end{definition*}

If we have an alphabet, $A$, then $A*$ denotes the infinite set of all strings made up of symbols in $A$ -- including
 $\Lambda$.
