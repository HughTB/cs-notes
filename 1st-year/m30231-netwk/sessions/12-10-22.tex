\practical{Collisions}{12:00}{12/10/22}{Athanasios Paraskelidis}

\begin{itemize}
  \item By design, the one cable at the centre of a bus topology network is shared between all computers on the network, and therefore collisions are very likely
  \item A domain is a region of a network where all devices listen to any communication on the network, and a bus network only has one domain
  \item You can find the domain by looking at where there is shared medium (a physical connection shared between multiple devices, such as a bus)
  \item A collision occurs when multiple devices try to communicate in the same domain at the same time
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Preventing Collisions}

CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection) algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] Is the medium idle (no other messages being sent)?
  \item Yes? Start transmitting
  \item No? Go back to the start of the algorithm
  \item[2.] Are there any collisions now?
  \item Yes? Continue sending packets for the minimum packet time (minimum time for a packet to transfer across the medium) to ensure the other node has detected the collision
  \item No? Finish transmission
  \item[3.] Has the maximum number of transmission attempts been reached yet?
  \item Yes? Abort the communication
  \item No? Wait for a random length of time, then go back to the start of the algorithm (the node with the shortest time to wait will transmit first)
\end{itemize}
