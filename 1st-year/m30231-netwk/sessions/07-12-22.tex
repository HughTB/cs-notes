\practical{Excel Noise Simulation}{12:00}{07/12/22}{Athanasios Paraskelidis}

\begin{itemize}
  \item To enter a periodic in Excel, you put \verb|=Cell+MinAmplitude/10| e.g. \verb|=A2+0.007/10| the first cell must be 0
  \item To enter the equation, you put \verb|=A*SIN(f*PI()*t)| e.g. \verb|=10.5*SIN(100*PI()*A2)|
  \item Then when you limit the equation to the bandwidth, you remove any terms that have a frequency higher than the bandwidth
  \item To add in the attenuation, you multiply the entire equation by the previously calculated attenuation
  \item To add noise, we need to use the rand function. In this case, we want noise that varies from 2.5 to -2.5
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To get this, we add \verb|+(RAND() * (max - min) + min)| in this case, \\
    \verb|+(RAND() * (2.5 - -2.5) - 2.5)|
  \end{itemize}
