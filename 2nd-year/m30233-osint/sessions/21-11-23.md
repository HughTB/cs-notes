## Main Memory

- Usually volatile, Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Large area of memory, typically several gigabytes on modern computers
- Each byte of memory has a unique numeric address and can be read from or written to by the CPU
  - The address is typically 64-bits in length in modern computers, but can be 32-bits on older computers
- CPU instructions are able to move data between main memory and the CPU registers
- The instructions for currently executing programs are also stored in main memory, and loaded by the CPU

## Physical Addresses

- The physical address of a byte of memory is a value between 0 and the number of bytes of available memory
- If the addresses used in instructions were physical addresses, it would be very hard to use multiprogramming
- It is possible to automatically add an offset to a physical address, but then it is possible for programs to interfere with each other by writing outside of their allocated memory
- User programs could also write into sections of memory allocated to the operating system, causing the system to crash or become unstable

### Address Spaces

- An address space is a way of abstracting memory access
  - It allows sharing of memory between processes
  - Comparable with the thread abstraction used for sharing CPU resources
- It makes it appear to the program as though it has it's own private memory space addressed between 0 and however much memory is assigned

## Virtual Memory

- Modern PCs use virtual memory
- Each process is assigned its own virtual address space, typically ranging from 0 to $2^{64} - 1$ for 64-bit processors or $2^{32} - 1$ for 32-bit processors
- All static memory addresses written into the program refer to the virtual address space, rather than the actual addresses in physical memory
- The vast majority of programs only use a small fraction of the available virtual address space
  - Any virtual addresses that are not used by a program simply do not have physical memory mapped to them
  - If a program were to need more memory than is available in the physical memory, they are mapped instead to secondary storage, which has a large performance penalty, but with the advantage of not crashing the program

### Implementation

- Virtual memory is usually implemented using paging
- The virtual address space is divided into pages of a fixed size, for example 4 kilobytes
- At any point in time, the page can either by mapped to a frame of physical memory, or unmapped
- An unmapped page is usually stored in secondary storage, such as a hard drive or SSD
- Paging requires both Softare and Hardware support
  - The MMU (Memory Mapping Unit) in the CPU translate addresses from virtual to physical
  - If the page of memory is not mapped, it raises an interrupt (often called a page fault)
  - The operating system handles the interrupt by mapping the page to an available frame of memory, and copying it's contents into main memory

## The Page Table

- Each process has its own mapping of pages in its virtual address space and the frames of physical memory
- This mapping is stored in a structure known as the page table
  - The page table is stored in main memory
  - It's managed by the OS but has to be interpereted by the MMU and so the format depends upon the CPU architecture
- The page table typically contains more than just the mapping between pages and physical memory
  - There is usually also a 'dirty bit' which records if the frame was modified since it was loaded into memory

### Address Translation

- To get the actual position in physical memory, we must convert from a virtual address to a physical one
- We have to figure out the offset of the address from the address of the start of the page it's in
- We can do this by calcuating the remainder after dividing the virtual address by the size of a page
  - e.g. Virtual address $8196$ is $8196 \mod 4096 = 4$ 4 bytes offset from the start of the $8196 / 4096 = 2$ 2nd page
- This process is automatically done by the MMU
  - Software only knows the virtual address
  - Memory only knows the physical address
- Since this is done in hardware, it is fast enough to not be a performance bottleneck

### Handling Page Faults

- If the page is not in the page table, it is not currently mapped and therefore a page miss has occured
- When this happens, the MMU raises it's interrupt and the page is mapped by the operating system before execution continues
- The operating system may have to evict another page from the memory so there is a free frame
- The evited page may need to be copied back to the secondary storage, if it has been modified since it was loaded
- The operating system must select which page to evict from memory, which it does using a PRA (Page Replacement Algorithm)

### Page Replacement Algorithms

- There are several page replacement algorithms which may be used, such as
  - Not Recently Used
  - First In, First Out
  - Second Chance
  - Clock
  - Least Recently Used

### Page Table Implementation

- There are two factors which must be considered when designing a page table
- Speed
  - The table has to be accessed for every memory reference, so speed is important
  - If we have to read through the entire page table for every reference, it will become a huge bottleneck to the performance of the computer
- Size
  - For a 32-bit address space, with 4KB pages, a 1D array would have a size of $1.049 \times 10^{12}$ entries per process
  - It is therefore neccessary ro reduce the size of the page table
- For a 32-bit address space, it is possible to use a two-level page table to reduce the number of references needed
- For a 64-bit address space however, a much less conventional method is needed - an inverted page table - but we won't cover that
