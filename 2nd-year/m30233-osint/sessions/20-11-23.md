# OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) 09:00 20/11/23

- OSPF was originally designed to overcome the issues with RIP
  - Improved convergence
  - Decreased likelihood of routing loops
  - Usable in larger networks
- Supports classless addressing and subnetting
- Designed as an Internet protocol, allowing interconnection between WANs
- Learns routes using the pervasive routing protocol to handle inter-domain routing on the Internet
- Supports hierarchical routing
  - Creates a routing tree and determines which destinations are accessible through which routers
- An autonomous system is a set of routers which exist on the same LAN, and are controlled by one organisation
  - An autonomous system can be divided into multiple, smaller areas which only share select information between themselves
  - This makes it much easier to maintain and administer-
  - Increases convergence speed as only select data is sent between routes in different areas
- A much less chatty protocol, so less bandwidth is consumed sending routing updates

## OSPF Route Summarisation

- OSPF areas are arranged into a two-level hierarchy
  - One level is a central backbone area
  - Areas in the second level are connected to the backbone

## Advantages

- Highly configurable
- Can reduce the bandwidth used for the routing protocol itself
- No hop count limitation
- Faster convergence using small routing updates
- Less prone to routing loops, due to fast convergence
- Routing updates are sent using multicast
- Optional authentication for updates to prevent rogue routers
- Can use multiple routes for traffic to the same destination

## Disadvantages

- Complex to configure as compared to RIP
- Can only be used in IP networks (not really a problem anymore)
- Can use multiple routes at once, but only if they have the exact same cost
- Summarises routes at area borders only
- May require reconfiguration of subnets and addressing schemes to get a desired sumarisation of routes

## Learning Routes

- Determine which neighbours you are directly connected to
  - Build a relationship with direct neighbours by establishing a link
- Synchronise link-state databases with all neighbours
  - The relationship with direct neighbours is upgraded to the adjacent status
  - Only the link-state information is shared with neighbours, not the route information
- Run the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm
- Populate the routing table with information from the SPF algorithm
- Now you can commence routing

## Routing Updates

- Rather than broadcasting information, OSPF only sends information to directly connected neighbours
- It also only sends the link-state database
- Each router then adds it's own updates before relaying it to it's directly connected neighbours
- This allows every router on the network to build a complete map of the network and topology
- The SPF algorithm then determines the fastest route through the network to each destination based upon this information

### Link-State Advertising

- The data is stored in a link-state database (LSDB)
- Every router maintains it's own LSDB
- When all routers in the area share the same LSDB, the network is considered to be converged
- The LSDB is populated using information from updates from neighbouring routers
- A router may request more information when receiving an LSA
- Each router must be adjacent to at least one other router, else it would be unable to receive LSAs
- LSAs are sent using multicasts to reduce the impact on the network
- The process of forwarding an LSA is known as flooding
- Only the router ID and state of their directly connected networks is sent
- The Split Horizon rule is applied once again, reducing the liklihood of routing loops
- OSPF never sends it's routing table to other routers, only the LSDB

### The SPF Algorithm

- It creates a shortest-path tree with the local router at the root of the tree
- Each router runs SPF itself, and creates a view of the network from it's perspective
- The shortest path to each network in the tree is calculated, and the routing table is populated based upon this
- If a network appears in the tree more than once, only the route with the lowest cost is kept
- The most commonly used metric for OSPF is the bandwidth of the links

## Routing Table

- The routing table for OSPF is almost identical to RIP
- The key difference is that routes discovered by OSPF are labelled with the code O
- Additionally, the administritive cost of OSPF is 110 rather than the 120 of RIP

### Maintaining Routes

- Once the SPF algorithm has been run, OSPF attempts to generate as little traffic as possible
- To ensure that the routes are still running, a HELLO packet is send every 10 seconds to keep the relationship alive (effectively a ping)
- The LSDB is re-flooded every 30 minutes to ensure that nothing has become corrupted
- LSAs are also resent periodically to ensure that the LSDBs are still synchronised

### Network Failures

- If a link failes, the failure is likely to be detected before the HELLO packet is even sent, due to the loss of Layer 2 keep-alive packets
- Once detected, and a router has timed out, the neighbouring router will notify it's neighbours of a change in the network
