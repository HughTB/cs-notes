# {BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)}{09:00}{27/11/23}{Athanasios Paraskelidis}

- BGP is a Path Vector based algorithm
- It is used to connect autonomous systems together
- Designed originally in 1989
- The current version of BGP (BGP-4) was created in 1994, and incuded support for CIDR
- BGP is primarily used to connect large WANs together, such as connecting ISPs to one another
- Some large companies use BGP, especially if they need multiple links from different ISPs, as it has support for failover
- Some even larger companies use BGP to peer different geographic locations together
- BGP is very complex and should not be used as the default option for a large network, especially if there is an alternative available, such as OSPF
- There is also a high likelihood that a backdoor might be open in a BGP network, unless configured by a highly competent engineer

## How BGP Works

- BGP is a path vector algorith, and as such it advertises paths and not links
- The path is the entire path from source to destination, containing a list of autonomous systems which packets must pass through to get to the destination
- BGP uses a variety of attributes to learn and assess each possible route
- Using said attributes allows routing policies to be enforced
  - Routing policies allow much greater control over how packets are routed
  - They also allow control over what routing prefixes are distributed between ISPs and their customers
  - This is especially helpful for companies to avoid their inter-office traffic being routed through certain countries, ISPs or networks to enhance security
- BGP is a deterministic system
  - This means that an administrator has full control over which routes are accepted or rejected
  - You can also set a static preference of one route over another
- Routing policies can also be used to enforce Service Level Agreements
  - This could include bandwidth limitations, total throughput, etc
- It is not uncommon for routing policies to be several thousand lines long in larger ISPs

### BGP Peer Sessions

- BGP enabled routers form peer relationships with other routers
- These have to be approved by the administrator
- A BGP router may have one or more peer relationships with other routers
- Unlike other protocols, this is done statically and not automatically when the router is turned on
- Peer relationships are only established between organisations which have service contracts with one another, such as ISPs or other organisation

## Autonomous Systems (ASes)

- BGP is used to connect ASes together
- An AS is a collection of networks controlled by the same administrator(s)
- A single organisation may have their own AS, depending upon their scale
- There is no specific maximum size for an AS, moreso practical limits such as number of IP addresses or geographical area
- Most ISPs have one or more ASes which contain numerous customers, including businesses or individual clients
- Every Autonomous System has it's own identification number, a universally unique Autonomous System Number (ASN)
  - These are assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)
- The North American ASN authority is ARIN
  - The ASNs are 16-bit numbers ranging from 1-65535, but only up to 64511 are public ASNs
  - The private ASNs are utilised for functions such as peering between ISPs, but never exposed on the internet
- As with IPv4, we are running out of ASNs to assign to ASes and as such a new protocol, in the same vein as IPv6, will eventually be needed
