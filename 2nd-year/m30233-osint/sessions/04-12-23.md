# {Routing Security}{09:00}{04/12/23}{Athanasios Paraskelidis}

- Confidentiality - Protecting data from being read by unauthorised users
- Integrity - Protecting data from being modified by unauthorised users
- Availability - Ensure authorised users are able to access the data when needed

- Authentication verifies that a user is who they say they are
- Authorisation gives users their access rights and prevents access to other information
- Accounting ensures that users can be held accountable for their actions

## Router Security

- Since routers have ultimate control over all of the data exiting a network, it is important to secure them
- They can
  - Spy on you
  - Reroute from a real website to a phishing website
  - Infect devices on it's network
  - Change data in-flight
  - Block access to the internet or specific websites
- Major vulnerabilities include
  - Using the default username and password
  - Using out-of-date firmware
  - Using standard ports
- It is much easier to perform a DoS (Denial of Service) attack against a router as they are typically much less powerful than a server
- Performing a DoS on a router is also likely to take down an entire network, rather than a single computer or service

### Routing Table Poisoning

- If an attacker is able to deploy a router into a network, they are able to poison the routing tables of actual routers
- It does this by sending malicious updates to the other routers on the network
- If the other routers install these updates, their table becomes poisoned
- This can be used to intercept traffic, or even drop it entirely by routing to an invalid path
- This can be avoided by using authentication for routing updates
  - RIPv2 has support for up to a 16 character password, and MD5 checksums
  - OSPFv2 uses the same exact authentication methods as RIPv2
