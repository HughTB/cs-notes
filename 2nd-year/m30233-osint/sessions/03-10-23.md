# Concurrency 13:00 03/10/23

- A sequential system is one where multiple threads are exectued to completion, one after the other
- A concurrent system is one where multiple threads are exectued at the same time
- A parallel system is one where multiple threads are executed in parallel, usually on multiple hardware threads

- There are several issues that may arise from concurrency, especially in cases where threads of the same process are run on multiple processors in parallel
  - A thread is a sequence of instructions defined by a program or part there of
  - A process has one or more threads, each of which may be run in parallel
  - Threads within a single process can share resources with each other, but have their own thread of execution
