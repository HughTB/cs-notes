\section*{Active Information Gathering}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Directly interacting with the target
  \item You typically gather more information actively, but you are much more likely to get caught
  \item Active methods include
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Probing the Network (Port scanning, service version enumeration)
    \item Social Engineering (Password gathering with phishing)
    \item Directory and Share scanning
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Passive Information Gathering}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Avoid direct interaction as much as possible
  \item Much less likely to be caught, but less information is gathered
  \item Passive methods include
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using a Search Engine
    \item Physical Observation (Looking over shoulder when typing a password)
    \item DNS enumeration (Whois lookup, IP address lookup, shodan, etc)
    \item OSINT Framework (Open Source Intellegence Network - Google Dorking, shodan, social media analysis)
    \item GeoLocating people based upon images on social media
    \item Searching on pastebin and other similar websites for the target
    \item Looking on websites such as haveibeenpwnd.com to check if passwords for the target have been leaked
  \end{itemize}
